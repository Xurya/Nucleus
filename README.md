# Nucleus

Central control system for networking, monitoring, and communication. The goal of this project is to centralize connections between databases, devices, and servers for development. Security will be a major concern for this system, as it creates a single point of failure. 

To mitigate this during development, a gitignore will keep all sensitive metadata and information while this project is public of Github, and then once a foundation is built the project will be moved to private.
